Subject: Enable WebSocket Support for Node.js Application on streamcam.gutilopsa.com

Hello Support Team,

I am trying to deploy a Node.js application on streamcam.gutilopsa.com that requires WebSocket connections for real-time video streaming functionality.

The WebSocket connection is currently failing with the error:
"WebSocket connection to 'wss://streamcam.gutilopsa.com/signal' failed: WebSocket is closed before the connection is established."

I believe this issue is due to Apache's mod_proxy_wstunnel module not being enabled on my account, which is required to proxy WebSocket connections through the reverse proxy to my Node.js application.

Could you please:

1. Enable mod_proxy_wstunnel for my domain (streamcam.gutilopsa.com)
2. Configure the reverse proxy to properly handle WebSocket upgrade requests
3. Allow WebSocket connections on the /signal path

My Node.js application is configured to:
- Run on an internal HTTP port (assigned by cPanel)
- Handle WebSocket connections at the /signal endpoint
- Support both ws:// and wss:// protocols

This is a standard requirement for modern real-time web applications and your configuration should support it.

If there are any additional configuration steps I need to take on my end, please let me know.

Thank you for your assistance!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
